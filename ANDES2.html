    <strong>"The Miracle of the Andes refers to the remarkable survival story of the 1972 Andes flight disaster, where a Uruguayan rugby team's plane crashed in the Andes Mountains. The entire journey is filled with mystery, discomfort, and agony that is beyond one's imagination. The passengers survived the crash and endured 70 days of life-threatening situations, resorting to cannibalism, snowstorms, and many more hardships." Here's a condensed narrative</strong><br><br>
<strong style="font-size: 15px;">Beginning:</strong><br>
On October 12, 1972, a small chartered aircraft, Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, took off from Uruguay, South America, heading to Santiago, the capital of Chile. The plane carried 45 passengers, including players, their families, and friends, who were mostly members of the Old Christians Club rugby team from Uruguay. The expected duration of the journey was between 3-4 hours. The aircraft was scheduled to pass through the Andes, one of the longest mountain ranges in the world, which ultimately became catastrophic for the passengers.

On the day of departure, there was a storm originating in the mountains. When the pilots were made aware of the bad weather, they deemed it extremely dangerous to continue flying and decided to stop midway, planning to resume the flight the next day. The plane successfully landed in Mendoza, Argentina, for the night. On October 13, despite giving the storm a day to pass, the bad weather persisted. Within a few minutes of taking off, the aircraft encountered terrifying turbulence. Everyone on board was filled with fear and turmoil as the aircraft was enveloped in clouds and fog.

As the path slowly cleared, the pilots saw a huge rock they were rapidly approaching. Any attempt at survival seemed impossible as it was too late to avoid the collision. The plane crashed into the Andes Mountains, experiencing three collisions during the fall, which split the back and front portions and the left wing. The violent storm consumed passengers along with their seats, and to this day, some bodies have not been discovered. The crash claimed the lives of both pilots and 12 passengers, leaving the aircraft completely wrecked.

<h2>SURVIVAL AND CHALLENGES</h2>

</div>
<p>After the crash, out of 45 passengers, 33 people survived. Many were severely injured, but fortunately, there were two medical students among them who were not seriously hurt. They immediately began to check and treat their fellow passengers. Meanwhile, the Chilean Air Rescue Service (SARS) was notified of the situation, and without delay, a search operation began to look for survivors. After hours of searching, the mission was declared unsuccessful. Out of the 33 survivors, 5 did not make it through the night, reducing the number to 28.

The survivors decided to wait patiently and made a warm shelter using the scattered parts of the aircraft to withstand the cold. The next day (October 14), the search continued with 11 different aircraft from Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. The mission continued on both ends. The survivors even tried to use lipstick to write "SOS" on the aircraft to alert the rescue teams. When they realized they didn't have enough lipstick to write all the letters, they managed to draw an "X" using bags and suitcases. They saw three aircraft searching for them, but none succeeded in spotting them as the snow and the aircraft were both white, making it difficult to differentiate between them.

The survivors soon realized they might be stuck there for a longer period. To survive, they needed water. They managed to use a metal sheet as a solar collector to concentrate the sun’s rays and melt the snow, collecting the drops in empty wine bottles they had carried during the journey. They also used seat covers, wool, and cushions to keep themselves warm. Fernando Parrado, who had fallen into a coma on the day of the crash, regained consciousness on October 16. He discovered that he had lost his mother and that his 19-year-old sister was severely injured. Despite his efforts to keep her alive, she drew her last breath on the 8th day.

Surviving the -30 degrees Celsius high-altitude weather without proper food and water became increasingly challenging. The painful situation made the survivors prone to the risk of snow blindness due to the ultraviolet rays of the sun reflecting off the snow, and it is said that they only had three pairs of sunglasses among them. On October 21, 8 days after the crash, the rescue team gave up after 142 hours of searching and declared that there was no possibility of finding any survivors. They believed the crash had been fatal for all 45 passengers. As a result, the survivors were left alone to fight for their lives without any knowledge of the outside world.</p>

<h3>UNBEARABLE CHOICE</h3>

<p>
The day of October 29 holds a pivotal part of the story when the survivors were faced with an unbearable decision. The survivors began to run out of food and had little to no options left. Hence, they decided to resort to cannibalism to survive. They consumed the flesh of their deceased friends and relatives. Despite the moral and ethical dilemma, the survivors saw no other option to continue their lives. With the feeling of pain, heartbreak, and guilt in their hearts, they decided to eat the dead. Many were hesitant and even cried out in agony while making this decision, but they believed it was the only way to stay alive. By December 11, they had lost 6 more members due to an avalanche that buried their shelter under a thick layer of snow. This reduced their number from 27 to 19.</p>

<p>
In an attempt to find help, the survivors sent three people on an expedition, but they soon realized that traveling by foot in those conditions was almost impossible, and they had to return. They made multiple attempts to contact nearby people and send out signals, but nothing worked. One of the survivors, Nando Parrado, who had regained consciousness after being in a coma, was determined to find help. He, along with Roberto Canessa, decided to go on another expedition. On December 20, after a 10-day journey through the treacherous mountains, they finally came across a Chilean shepherd, Sergio Catalán. The shepherd gave them food and water and notified the authorities about the survivors. On December 22, 72 days after the crash, the remaining 16 survivors were rescued. Their survival against all odds is considered one of the most extraordinary and harrowing tales of endurance and human spirit.</p>
